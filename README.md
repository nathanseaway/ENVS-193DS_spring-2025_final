Final Exam for Env S 193DS

# General Information

This repository includes my work for the final exam for Env S 193DS: including all coding and writing portions of the exam. The exam consisted of four problems: research writing, data visualization, data analysis, and affective and exploratory visualizations. 

The data set for the data visualization portion came from:
Kui, L. 2024. Daily sea surface temperature in Santa Barbara channel between 1982 and 2023 ver 3. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/e930954949b2635928b8be6824630f84. Accessed 2025-06-09.

The data set for the data analysis portion came from:
Stojanovic, Dejan; Owens, Giselle; Young, Catherine et al. (2021). Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9sb
